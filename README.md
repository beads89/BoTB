## Description

User names their band and hits the stage! In each level, the user will face off against a new band and attempt to raise the audience's hype bar to 100% before their opponent. To battle, the user can chorus(straight up attack to raise hype), solo(charge an attack for extra hype), focus(charge defense against the opponent's next turn), or flourish(attack with a random chance of extra hype). If the user beats the other band, they gain that opponent as a bandmate. Snappy dialogue from opponents and bandmates tells the story of the user's journey from garage band to sold out stadium.
